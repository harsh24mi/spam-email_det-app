## üìÑ Project Overview & Vision

The initial goal was to build a simple spam detector. However, the project evolved into a comprehensive demonstration of professional software engineering and machine learning practices. The application is architected to be robust, scalable, and maintainable, featuring a decoupled frontend and backend, a containerized environment with Docker, and a custom AI model trained to overcome the limitations of pre-existing, general-purpose models.

This project is not just a proof-of-concept; it is a showcase of the iterative process of building and refining an intelligent system, including analyzing its failures and systematically improving its performance.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Technical Highlights

* **Custom Fine-Tuned Model:** Fine-tuned a **DistilBERT** model on the **Enron Email Dataset** using a **GPU on Google Colab**, achieving high accuracy on real-world email patterns.
* **Scalable Backend Architecture:** Engineered with **Flask** using a modular structure (**Blueprints**) to separate concerns. It exposes a clean **REST API** for predictions, making the backend independent of the frontend.
* **Modern, Asynchronous Frontend:** A responsive and user-friendly interface built with **Bootstrap** and vanilla **JavaScript**. It uses the `fetch` API to communicate with the backend without page reloads, ensuring a smooth user experience.
* **Containerized for Production:** The entire application is containerized with **Docker**, guaranteeing a consistent and reproducible environment for both development and deployment.
* **Automated Testing:** Includes a suite of **unit tests** for the API endpoint, written with **pytest**, to ensure code quality and reliability.
* **Professional MLOps Workflow:** The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow:
    1.  **Problem Identification:** Realized a baseline sentiment model was insufficient.
    2.  **Data Sourcing & Cleaning:** Processed the complex Enron dataset.
    3.  **GPU-Powered Training:** Leveraged Google Colab for efficient model fine-tuning.
    4.  **Deployment:** Deployed the containerized application and model to Hugging Face Spaces.
    5.  **Iteration:** Analyzed the model's "false positives" and identified the next steps for improvement (augmenting the dataset).
